  #   There must be a function to which a country name should be passed as an argument.
  # On the screen there should be all of the current measurements in that country,
  # and the city with the highest and lowest measurement value.
  # Processes, tasks or agents shall be used. The code structure and the way of implementation are fluid.
  # For ease use these dependencies:
  # https://hex.pm/packages/httpoison - for http requests
  # https://hex.pm/packages/jason - for jason encoding and decoding

  # *You can use any dependency of your liking as long as it has the needed functionality.*
  # *The lack of usage of dependencies can be used only when new free of dependency implementation is wanted by the student.*
